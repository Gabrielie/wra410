# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.
* The background color was changed to the MSU Green.
* The color of the header was changed to Orange so the page looks more energetic, the color was pulled from the MSU brand website. 
* The background color of the container was also changed to a light grey because I found the pure white color was kind of unpleasant to look at in a dark background.

2. Use a new font.
For the font, I tried Gotham and Californian first because they are the brand typography of MSU, but there is no open source for these two fonts, so I have to find another one. At the end I decided to use a font called Titillium Web, it is a sans-serif font with straight sharp lines, I believe it has some kind of futuristic and high-tech feeling, and it is easy to read as well.

3. Include two images.
* in the contact page, a photo of professor Monberg was added.
* In the group page, a cartoon style image of group work was added, I believe the solving puzzle can be the symbol of the central idea of group working in this class, everyone use their piece of knowledge to work together, and accomplish something that couldn't be done by one.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.
* I put the grading scale into a table in both assignments and assignment 1 pages. 
* I put the line height into 2, so everything is clearer.
* In the grading scale of the assignments page, I changed 4(gpa) to 4.0, and 3 to 3.0 so the table looks clearer.

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, separate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  
* I changed the link color to a dark orange so it works better with the heading.
* I edited all students' name into grids so they aligned better.

6. Add navigation to the Schedule webpage.
* I revised the schedule page and include the navigation bar on the side. 

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.
* I revised the rows and columns by giving it a different background color, and double spaced all list so it is easier to read.

other changes:
* The padding on the left side of the heading was removed, so everything looks well aligned, no weird indent on the left side anymore.
* Reformat the heading of the Schedule page, so it has an orange heading like every other pages.
* Rename all subheadings in the content to <h3> (was <h2>), only the heading of the pages are <h2>, so I can set up different font sizes for them.
* Double spaced all <ul> and <table> , so they won't squeeze together anymore.
* the Course Catalog Description on the index page was reformatted to <h3>Reading Response
* All the link will change to a darker orange when you hover your mouse on it. and that hover color change has a transition effect that takes 0.3 second.
